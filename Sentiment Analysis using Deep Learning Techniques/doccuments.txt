the cvs cashier asked me how im doing as i put some diarrhea medicine on the counter. "not great man ive got diarrhea" i told him
I always opt for using the hand dryer instead of paper towels for those people waiting to fart in bathroom stalls. Youre welcome.
WIFE: I think this place is haunted.ME: (trying to find something to blame my fart on) Sure smells haunted.
I have so much butt hair my diarrhea comes out as filtered drinking water.
When you're around your crush but you gotta fart real bad
When you give your cat his diarrhea medicine without any problems

moron: "duhh, i hate taco bell, every time i go there i get diarrhea" me: try getting tacos instead, genius
My butt crack hair. Like a wig stuffed between the sofa cushions. The vertical mustache. A dense, dark jungle where light never breaks the canopy and the animals walk right up to you because theyve never seen people before. Wow you read all of that. Gross. But thanks, I guess.
How much can this one swallow?sir that one does 1.6 gallons per flush and please stop describing it that way
it's cool when my one dog shits the other one has to go and inspect it like "just as i suspected guys. it's shit."

A bottle washes onto the shore. There's a note inside. You pick it up and pull the cork. Aged fart fills your nose. The note says "LOL"
It's important to conserve water but u SHOULD keep  flushing until u feel confident your poop is in the ocean
If yr nervous about farting in yoga just remember: that could happen to anyone. The part that takes true serenity is letting out a tiny poop
Casual Friday is the BEST! Who likes washing their hands after going to the bathroom?!
Jack in the Box tacos aren't tacos. They're more like a wet envelope of cat food. When you eat them you're just mailing yourself diarrhea.
Im uploading a fart onto the dark web
imagine if poop was transparent. Id completely lose my shit
Ten years after my death, my best friend finally opens the package I left him in my will. Hes confused by the empty box. He wonders if theres been a mistake. Then, he smells the fart. Laughing, my ghost can now rest in peace.
Diarrhea. The green apple splatters. Booty sneezes. # 1 from # 2. I scared the squid. Get the wet nurse, I'm having a natural water birth.
I bought a crimson Harvard t-shirt and unless you pay me $50 I'm going to wear it to the mall and pee my pants
maggot-covered cheese 
The long and short of it is that bull penis is featured on menus in China, and is purported to have aphrodisiacal powers.
In Sardinia, you start by cracking open the cheese and letting a whole lot of flies settle in. As they eat, poop and lay their eggs in the cheese, the flies impart unique flavors that are only improved by the texture of the wriggling maggots after they hatch
the century egg is a duck, chicken or quail egg steeped for up to five months in a special broth that includes black tea, salt, lime and wood ash.
In Peru, people have been raising and eating guinea pigs 
Soup made with fruit bats was so popular in Guam that the bats were nearly eaten into extinction
Haggis, a much-loved pudding in Scotland, is made of minced sheep's liver, lungs and heart, combined with onions, fat and oatmeal.
The pudding is cooked in a casing  traditionally a sheep's stomach.
up to 500 small birds called auks are stitched up inside a sealskin and stored under a rock for three months they are eaten
Found in southern China and in Korea, this alcoholic brew is infused with the bodies of hairless baby mice.
 sticky, slimy soybeans fermented with the bacteria Bacillus subtilis  is a traditional dish and a popular breakfast food.
Pickled sheep eyeballs served floating in juice are sometimes used as a hangover remedy in Mongolia.
Made in Sardinia, su gallu is a cheese that ferments in the stomach of a slaughtered baby goat, made from the sheep's milk that was its very last meal.

But what a send off from the fantastic people of Sunderland  !!!!"

"Shame for Egypt.. 
Egypt tourism should be booming.. 
Wtf is wrong with People?!?
Its really disheartened and those culprits should suffer the deadpenalty
The killing of these two westerners should be counted as the profit angle by their leaders for painting Islam Black.
What stupid goes to Egypt for tourism ??
What a horrible world we live in
I hate living in jeffersonville, indiana
The editors of the BBC should be suspended for filing in the News page with unimportant stories.Rather than focusing on the plight of Syrians and Yemeni. Such mino stories make BBC now sounds like a local Radio Station.
How about you run over to Syria or Yemen and try to make a difference with your own head.. I mean hands.
I can see a child's buggy!!! Put yourself in danger if you must but not your child. Morons!!!!
Uma Sepsi yay more stupid people!!
"St. Martin needs to close this beach to protect idiots from themselves.
On another note, no where in this does it say that New Zealand is or near the Caribbean (as some of the other commenters have suggested)... It, in fact, states: ""A New Zealand woman has died doing this on the Caribbean territory of Sint Martin."""
"There is fence but some idiots climb it, the only solution is to close the beach."
"Have these thrill seekers no thoughts for their children, in the middle of a jet blast, smoke pollution.
Why some people bother having children beats me when they put them in danger. It actually killed one lady."
It's called thinning the herd, let them do it. If you see the sign pointing out the danger and do it anyway, you kinda have it coming to you.
Therefore proof that the BBC news is continually sharing fake news
It's a conspiracy I say!!!!!"
"The video is correct on location, but your lead-in comment is not.
And why in the hell are people taking small children in strollers to this location???!!!!"
Omg why the hell would you take your kid there?? Hope the wee baby ok and should be rules against kids being allowed there to
I think that any parent putting there child in such great risk should be investigated by the authorities, absolutely disgusting,
Wouldn't go anywhere near that place. I'd be terrified, not to mention deafened, every time a plane came in. Thought it was a joke or photoshopped when I first heard about this place a few months ago. I just don't get how it can even be allowed to happen ..planes getting so close to people.
I just wonder.....WHY & HOW did humanit became so STUPID......WHAT DID HAPPEN to our brains..........Is it a cultural inbreeding, or foods/water/chemicals, or all together............????????????
This just looks so dumb. Like really people. You go to a tropical destination and you want to hang out getting a wind from jets? What a waste.
Is the BBC being run by the The Sun...? The Sun ran this today - it's old news about the woman being killed! Struggling for drama today are we?
Idiots on the beach holding on to the fences when it clearly says not to do so + jet engine blasts 
yes, let's say, if the want to do it, do it on their own risk. Fair enough. But one of the guy was holding a child, and that is just not ok. At all.
if you going to do a report on a country get the name correct. It is  Sint Maarten Not New Zealand
Well,Hawaii, you can kiss my tourist money goodbye. Good luck when the illegals start assaulting and murdering your citizens. Don't come crying for help. You brought this on yourselves
Ironic that Trump being a granddad himself cannot fathom simple things.
"Grandparent are attacking US.
US. is unsafe, search their walkers, wheelchairs, and medications' containers"
Donnie is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people.
"I find it difficult to believe some one would try to discourage people to visit Hawaii with this type of statement or ruling
That judge is going to get himself kicked off the bench.
So the same Obama judge who has been shut down several times for his partisan bs has tried it again?
After reading some of the comments here I'm starting to wonder idf anyone actually read the story
Don't worry about keeping America safe from Muslims. Christians fill our prisons.
I'm a grandmother but not a family member? What am I then? This travel ban is crazy.
How it is they were never included in the first place is beyond rational logical thinking.
if americans cant get rid of this orange maggot, he will run for re-election in 2020 and probably win.
Only in Trump world would grandparents not be considered close family
It is is time to rid the judiciary of that idiot.  He gives the system a black eye
Supreme Court is the highest office or not?! Hawai is just a jurisdiction! How can a simple judge overrule ?! Can somebody tell me ?
It does say an awful lot about Trumps understanding of relationships
time as american people let president do his job  the last fool did let this fool too
Failed state countries that hate the US anyway... impossible to verify anyone from there.  There is no right to immigrate or even visit the US.
That ugly old face..... why do you have to show it? Just put the #45 in its place.
The BBC wants the USA be invaded just like Europe has been.
Trump advisers and his administration are delusional set of people..
I'd like to send a passing comment  that he's in a really bad shape. Looking like an orange pile of crap...
A stupid ban. My granparents are almost like part of our family.
Trumpkins are lacking many brain cells.
"America is the last safe country for westerners thanks to tolerant liberals. 
Let that sink in."
Somebody should sack that Judge.
It shows how weak an American President is.
Thanks for the heads up, now I should be able to score drugs on Instagram.
WON'T SOMEBODY THINK OF THE CHILDREN???
"They know the biggest gang for drugs selling?!.....
Ok then, when police captured them?!"
Ralph Melanson i just cant get over the image used
And if you don't pay they can find you quickly on that stupid map feature. Whats the world coming too??
"This is scandalous! Absolutely scandalous!
I can't believe people are still selling and using drugs!"
Another Bollock article from the BBC. Didn't you people used to employ journalists?
Haha! Leave the kids alone to have some fun!
Perhaps the worst BBC article I've ever read. Very disappointing.
This is fake news
The best way to treat a chemical burn is to throw the lowlife scumbags who use it, in prison for the rest of their miserable lives
How the hell are they getting hold off these illegal chemicals in the first place??!!!
"We shouldn't be learning how to deal with acid attacks . We should be dealing with the scum who use this as a weapon . 
If you have snake in the grass do you walk around on tippy toe - or do you capture the snake and reallocate them . Send the scum back to their origins ."
White guy commits hate crime reported as robbery but that was a muslim who threw acid on a white face it would be announced as global terrorist attacke
If the persons responsible are caught they should get a life sentence.  there needs to be a very strong approach to this type of terrorism.
"If the Gov made a minimum mandatory  5 year prison ,, I am sure those criminals would think twice.
Also make a offence  carrying acid substance on you or at easy reach."
"1500 attacks in the last 5 years; leading boroughs are Newham 400, Barking 130, tower hamlets 80
If someone threw acid in my face and disfigured me for life.I'd take the law into my own hands and do time in prison.
What has happened to this country?
I don't give a s**t what colour or religion these crazy b******s are, they're just plain evil to do this to anyone!
This is a vile thing to do to any person. Why do they do it?! I think as a lesson they should get some acid treatments when in prison while  serving time..that will teach them a lesson..
Agree..bet way to treat chemical burns is to get rid of the scumbags... maybe throw in a life sebtence... and if possible  make them dissapear so no one need to pay for these lunatics...
Yesterday Acid attacks targeting foreigners in London wasn't reported by the BBC.
Didn't look like he was ran over. He lay between the tracks of the tank
Stupid turkish.
Shouldn't run in front of a fast moving tank, they can't stop on a dime. Moron
Thats damm evil. They need to roll over the driver.
real or not, true or not...WTF was he thinking! Crazy man! 
Stupid white guy... He needs schooled by the BLM idiots how to do that properly!
He's a complete utter idiot for doing this anyway!!!
Now Trump will run over him ..
It wasnt a coup, it was a clear out by Erdogan
Those names are horrific
They are not your kids. Why do u even care about their names, haters.
Ridiculous!
